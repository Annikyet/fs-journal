## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Function Declaration
```js
function myFunction(parameter) {
  do.stuff()
}
```

Function Expression
```js
let value = function(parameter) {
  do.stuff()
}
```

Arrow/Lambda Expression
```js
let value = (parameter) => {do.stuff()}
```

They operate the same, but the last two are anonymous functions that cannot be called elsewhere (as they don't have a declared name)

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Arguments are values passed to the function at invocation. Parameters are the variables that arguments are passed through at declaration.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A function that takes or returns another function as a value.
```js
setInterval(myFunction, 1000)
```
