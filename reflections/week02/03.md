## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

```js
console.log('message')
console.alert('alert')
console.error('error')
```

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

`Elements` allows to view computed styles (which style rule has specificity), as well as parameters like margins, padding and colors. Can also show what the output `innerHTML` is from javascript.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Use the `debugger`.
