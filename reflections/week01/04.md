## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wire-framing keeps the design focused on the user, not the code. It also allows developers to play with design easily, much more quickly than when coding.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Lofi wireframes to study and relax to: basically just a napkin drawing. Just getting the overall layout and ideas down.

Medium-fi wireframe: Has more defined boxes, with colors, font-sizes, weights and other aesthetic choices. No text or images.

Hi-fi wireframes: Pixel-perfect layouts, includes actual text and images. Should look nearly identical to finished product.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think it's worth doing a 1-2 wireframes. Lofi to figure out what kind of layout should be used. Then a medfi to get the layout, fonts picked, etc. Beyond that it's probably easier to tweak the actual website using CSS or Bootstrap (and adjacent libraries), then spend a ton of time in a tool like figma obsessing over pixels, just to do it again. (But what do I know? I'm halfway up that Dunning-Kruger curve...)
