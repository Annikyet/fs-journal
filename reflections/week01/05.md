# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Mostly review, HTML/CSS is still pretty fresh in my mind. I feel like I have a much stronger grasp on how BS5/CSS works, how to troubleshoot what went wrong, and how to make it do exactly what I want it to.

I'll be switching to Bootswatch (maybe eventually Tailwind/SCSS/custom CSS library?) so I'm not fighting the default Bootstrap styling.

I'm really struggling to stay on the bigger picture and frequently get caught in styling rabbit holes (even when the task is JS, not styling).

I'd count the speed and ease that I can throw together a static webpage a victory, and one that will doubtlessly help me get through the course and eventually become a developer.
