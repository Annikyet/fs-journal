# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I'm really struggling with Vue. It throws a lot of unintuitive concepts, and flips all the JS syntax on its head. Also adds a ton of its own idiosyncratic behavior, and frankly I just don't understand it. It may as well be an entire new language for how different it is.
