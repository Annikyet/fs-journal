## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
Row is a specific entry. Column is the name of an attribute.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
INSERT INTO characters ('id' INT, 'name' VARCHAR(255), 'age' VARCHAR(255), 'descipriont' VARCHAR(255));
(definitely not right)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
the first removes rows FROM table_name, the second DELETES table_name.
